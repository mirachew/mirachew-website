# Hydraulically Interconnected Tractor Suspension

**Farm-ng | Summer 2025**

Designed and built a hydraulically linked suspension system for autonomous tractors using CNC machining, sheet metal fabrication, and laser cutting. Focused on durability, manufacturability, and ride stability.

## The Problem
Tractors are used in fields with uneven ground where Farm-ng's small autonomous tractors underperform; wheels spin in the air; the tractor may tip. Finding an inexpensive solution to keep all four wheels in contact with the ground is crucial to the tractor's ability to traverse.

## Concept Development
Evaluated multiple suspension concepts—rubber torsion, mechanical linkage, and hydraulic cross-link—through CAD modeling and kinematic analysis. I selected the hydraulic cross-linked system for its ability to equalize load between wheels, provide greater travel without complex geometry/materials, offer fine control through fluid tuning, and is lower cost.

## Overview / My Role & Contributions
At Farm-ng, a startup developing autonomous tractors, I designed, fabricated, and tested a hydraulically cross-linked suspension system to enhance in-field traversing. I created detailed SolidWorks models, performed tolerance analysis, stress analysis, and iterated designs to optimize manufacturability, travel range, and cost. I validated 27° wheel articulation via hands-on prototyping and testing. I refined the design for production,  reducing manufacturing time by 36% and cost by 20%. This project strengthened my skills in parametric CAD, design for manufacturing, and practical prototyping, while balancing precision, robustness, and performance in a real-world agricultural robotics setting. My contributions directly advanced the tractor’s functional reliability and manufacturability.

## Testing & Validation
Conducted bench tests and kinematic simulaitons to validate suspension articulation and hydraulic feedback. Verified 27° articulation and cross-linking behavior through deflection measurements.

Result: Tractor maintained four-wheel contact across terrain step differences up to 45% of the wheel-base length.
