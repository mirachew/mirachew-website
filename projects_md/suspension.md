# Hydraulically Interconnected Tractor Suspension

**Farm-ng, Summer 2025**

Designed and built a hydraulically linked suspension system for autonomous tractors using CNC machining, sheet metal fabrication, and laser cutting. Focused on durability, manufacturability, and ride stability.

## The Problem
Tractors are used in fields with uneven ground where Farm-ng's small autonomous tractors underperform; wheels spin in the air; the tractor may tip. Finding an inexpensive solution to keep all four wheels in contact with the ground is crucial to the tractor's ability to traverse.

## The Process

## The Result

A title/project name
A one-liner about the project
The objective of the design project (e.g., the relevant design requirements, given or self-imposed)
The results of the design, and your evaluation of how well it met the initial objectives
A list of the skills you developed on this project
Visuals (visuals are the best driver of a portfolio, and text should be integrated to support the visuals)
Photograph of the final product
Photographs of the manufacturing process
CAD/renderings of your design
Exploded assembly drawing (see thi

Dimensioned drawings of final parts (tooling drawings are optional)
Any graphs or other analysis you completed
Three challenges you encountered/anticipated and an explanation of how you overcame them using DFM best practices. Here is where you can show you know the key elements for successful manufacturing and engineering. This is a good place to include technical analysis and detail that your engineering-focused audience will be looking for in your work. Challenges may include:
Tolerancing/dimensioning considerations
Geometry considerations
Assembly considerations
Material considerations
Temperature/pressure/timing considerations
Costing considerations
Additional details to include:
How much would your parts cost if you used a service like 3DHub (how does it change with quantity, material choice, finish).
An estimate of the cycle time required for each operation in the factory, guided by your analysis, assembly of the design, other experience lab, and intuition/research.
BOM with materials, COTS, and estimated manufacturing/assembly costs
