# Custom Hidden Function Furniture

**Olin College of Engineering | Spring 2024**

Designed and fabricated a custom stool for a senior citizen with mobility challenges, focusing on human-centered accessibility, height adaptability, lightweight construction, and discreet storage. The project involved iterative CAD design, TIG welding of aluminum, and balancing aesthetic and functional requirements.

## The Problem

The client required a stool that could assist with reaching elevated surfaces in the kitchen, while remaining unobtrusive when not in use. Key constraints included:  

- **Human-centered design:** Adapted for senior citizen use  
- **Height adaptability:** Incremental steps of 1 ft and 2 ft  
- **Compact storage:** Collapsible or minimal footprint  
- **Aesthetic integration:** Must blend seamlessly into kitchen design  
- **Lightweight and safe:** Strong enough to support the user, easy to move

## Concept Development

Explored multiple concepts including foldable wooden stools, telescoping aluminum structures, and hybrid collapsible frames. Using SolidWorks CAD modeling, I evaluated:

- Structural strength under user load  
- Folding mechanism and storage footprint  
- Ease of fabrication using TIG welding  

The final design uses a TIG-welded aluminum frame with integrated foot supports, chosen for its combination of lightweight construction, durability, and manufacturability. Iterations focused on harmonizing the stoolâ€™s aesthetic integration with functional requirements.

## Overview / My Role & Contributions

I led the full design and fabrication process, translating user needs into a functional, manufacturable solution:

- Developed parametric models in **SolidWorks**  
- Performed structural and bending analysis to verify load capacity  
- Fabricated the stool using **TIG welding** on aluminum tubing  
- Tested weld strength and overall stability through hands-on trials  
- Optimized folding mechanism for minimal footprint while preserving usability

The project strengthened skills in **human-centered mechanical design**, iterative prototyping, and precision welding, while balancing strength, weight, and ease of use.

## Testing & Validation

- Bench-tested weld joints by applying bending force to failure 
- Verified stool stability at each height increment (1 ft / 2 ft)  
- Confirmed the stool could be easily collapsed and stored without compromising strength or safety

**Result:** The stool reliably supported user weight, folded compactly, and visually integrated with the kitchen environment.
