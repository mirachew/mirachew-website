Perfect — this will make your site feel *way more human* and balanced next to all your technical work. You’ve got a **great mix** of creative, athletic, and hands-on hobbies, and if we design this right, it’ll subtly reinforce your engineering personality (precision, artistry, motion, teamwork).

Let’s split this into **two design layers**:

---

## 🏠 **Front Page Concept: “Hobbies Preview”**

**Goal:**
Catch attention without distracting from your main banner and projects — it should feel like a “personality accent,” not a separate section.

**Visual Style:**
Think **compact grid or strip**, similar to your “Projects” layout but smaller and simpler — something like this:

```
------------------------------------------------------------
|   Photography  |   Welding Art  |   Handball  |   Baking  |
|   (photo tile) |   (photo tile) |   (photo)   |   (photo) |
------------------------------------------------------------
                     [See All Hobbies →]
```

**Design Tips:**

* 4–6 **photo tiles** arranged in a single row or 2x2 grid.
* Each tile: slightly desaturated image that **brightens on hover** + displays the hobby name in white text overlay.
* The “See All Hobbies →” button at the bottom links to the dedicated hobbies page.
* Optional: You can pick 4 “representative” hobbies that show your range:

  * **Active:** Handball
  * **Artistic:** Welding or Pottery
  * **Outdoors:** Hiking or Water Sports
  * **Creative:** Baking or Photography

It keeps the preview visually balanced and diverse.

## 🌿 **Full Hobbies Page Layout**

**Goal:**
Show variety, personality, and taste *without reading like a resume*. This page should breathe visually — light background, minimal text, strong imagery.

---

### 🔹 Layout Option 1: **Masonry Gallery Style**

A Pinterest-style grid of uneven tiles (mixing photo sizes). Each tile includes:

* 1–2 images per hobby
* Hover effect → short caption (one line max)

**Example Flow:**

```
[Photo: Mira surfing]       [Photo: Welding art]
 Water Sports                 Welding Art

[Photo: Handball court]     [Photo: Fresh bread]
 Team Handball               Baking & Pastry
```

➡️ Great if you want something **visual-first**, with minimal reading.

---

### 🔹 Layout Option 2: **Alternating Sections**

For a more narrative feel — each hobby gets a short entry (2–3 lines of text), alternating image/text sides like this:

```
[Photo of Mira welding]        Welding Art
                               I started sculptural welding as a creative outlet for precision and design. My current favorite piece is a heron made from scrap steel.
---------------------------------------------------
Basketball                     [Photo of Mira dunking]
I’ve played since I was a kid — I love the speed, team strategy, and competition.
---------------------------------------------------
```

**Advantages:**

* Easy to organize
* Lets you write more expressive mini-stories
* Works better if you want to include **handball** and **Z3 car project** as featured hobbies.

---

### 🔹 Text Style Suggestions

Each hobby’s caption/description could be **one short paragraph (~25 words)** max:

> *I’ve been on the U.S. National Handball Team for both indoor and beach handball — it’s been an incredible outlet for teamwork, travel, and high-intensity focus.*

or

> *I love creating welded sculptures from scrap metal — blending industrial techniques with artistic flow.*

Tone should be **light, conversational, and visually descriptive**, not resume-like.

---

### 🔹 Optional Touches

* Subtle section dividers or headers by *theme*:

  * **Sports & Adventure** (basketball, handball, hiking, etc.)
  * **Creative & Technical** (welding, pottery, photography, baking)
  * **Nature & Relaxation** (fishing, gardening, water sports)
* A “back to top” arrow (you already have one!).
* A little photo collage banner at the top that rotates through hobbies.

---

If you tell me what *vibe* you want for the hobbies page (e.g., “clean gallery,” “personal storytelling,” “photo-heavy minimalist,” etc.), I can mock up the **exact visual layout hierarchy** (what goes where, photo ratios, text placement) — still no code, but a structured design plan.

👉 What kind of tone do you want this hobbies page to have — **artistic & visual**, **structured & minimal**, or **personal & story-driven**?
